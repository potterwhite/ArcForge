## [v0.3.0] - 2025-12-25

**Initial Public Release & Framework Consolidation**

This release represents the consolidation of the entire ArcForge development history into a single, stable baseline. It integrates the ASR Engine, complete build infrastructure, application prototypes, and rigorous compliance standards.

### 🚀 Features & Capabilities (核心功能)

*   **ASR Engine Integration**:
    *   Integrated `libs/asr_engine` powered by **Sherpa-Onnx** (C++ API).
    *   Full support for Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and WavReader utilities.
    *   **Offline Support**: Smart detection mechanism for local `sherpa-onnx` tarballs to enable offline builds.
*   **Application Prototypes**:
    *   **ASR Client/Server**: Complete, compilable prototypes for both Client and Server applications (ported from RK3588 architecture).
    *   Unified application logic designed for cross-SoC compatibility.
*   **Environment Management**:
    *   **Dotenv Support**: `build.sh` automatically loads developer-specific variables (e.g., custom SDK paths) from a local `.env` file, isolating personal configs from git.

### 🛠 Build System Architecture (构建架构)

*   **CMake Infrastructure**:
    *   **Modern CMake**: strict adherence to `target_sources` and "Convention Over Configuration" (COC) policies.
    *   **Presets-Driven**: `CMakePresets.json` centralized all dependency search logic and build configurations (Debug/Release, Install Paths).
    *   **Centralized Functions**: `cmake/ArcFunctions.cmake` provides standard macros like `arc_install_library`, `arc_init_global_settings`.
*   **Toolchain Standardization**:
    *   Refactored `rv1126bp` and `aarch64` toolchains with `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*` set to `ONLY` to prevent host pollution.
*   **Dependency Management**:
    *   **Dual-State Linking**: Supports both Monorepo mode (direct target aliases `ArcForge::Utils`) and Standalone mode (fallback to `find_package`).
    *   **FetchContent**: Automated management of external binaries (ThirdParty Artifacts).
*   **Modular Scripts**:
    *   Refactored `build.sh` into a modular, function-based runner with interactive mode support.

### ✅ CI/CD & Compliance (规范与合规)

*   **License Automation**:
    *   Included `scripts/universal_copyright_v3.1.sh` for intelligent, automated license header injection (Apache 2.0/MIT/etc.).
    *   Supports SPDX identifier auto-detection for complex licenses (e.g., LGPL).
*   **Gatekeeping**:
    *   Added GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/license-check.yml`) to strictly enforce license header compliance on every PR/Push.

### ♻️ Architecture Refactoring (架构重构)

*   **Namespace Unification**:
    *   Global C++ namespace standardized to `arcforge::embedded`.
    *   CMake targets standardized to `ArcForge::<Module>` (e.g., `ArcForge::Network`, `ArcForge::Utils`).
*   **Directory Structure**:
    *   Strict separation of `include/` (Public Headers) and `src/` (Private Implementation).
    *   Cleaned up model paths and deprecated archive directories.

### 📚 Documentation (文档)

*   **Guides**: Added `docs/ADD_NEW_SOC.md` comprehensive guide for extending platform support.
